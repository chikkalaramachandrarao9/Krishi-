  "Alluvial soils are fertile soil deposited by rivers on and near their banks. Alluvial soils are found in the Northern plains of the country and most fertile alluvial soil is found in the Ganga valley, where it is Deposited by river Ganges. These soils cover almost 35 to 40% of the region of India. Alluvial soils are Rich in minerals especially potash. They are a dark shade of grey and are extremely appropriate for Agriculture. Some dark black alluvial soil can be found in coastal areas.\n                Alluvial type of soil is common in Northern India, particularly in the delta regions. These soils are deposited by rivers and are rich in some nutrients (particularly potash and humus), but are lacking in nitrogen and phosphorous. They tend to be sandier and quicker-draining than other soils.\n               Alluvial soils vary in nature sandy loam to clay. These soils are loamy and clayey in the lower and middle Ganga plain and the Brahmaputra valley. The sand content decreases from the west to east direction. \n               The alluvial soils colour changes from the light grey to ash grey. And mainly depending on the depth of the deposition, the texture of the materials and time taken for attaining maturity. Based on geographical considerations, alluvial soil can be subdivided into two divisions. They are:\n                •	Khadar ( newly formed alluvial soil ) \n               •	Bhangar (old alluvial soil) Both types are different in texture, chemical composition, drainage capacity, and fertility. \n               The Khadar Is a light friable loam with a mixture of sand and silt It is mainly found in the river valley, the Floodplains, and deltas. On the other hand, the Bhangar lies on the interfluves. The higher proportion Of clay creates the soil sticky and drainage is often poor. \n               Almost all crops are grown on these alluvial Soils. Before getting into commercial agriculture, you must be aware of crops suitable for alluvial soil. Alluvial soils are mostly flat and regular soils and are best suited for agriculture. Alluvial soils are best suited to the irrigation system and respond well to canal and well or tube-well irrigation. They yield splendid crops of rice, wheat, sugarcane, tobacco, cotton, pulses, oilseeds, jute, maize, oilseeds, leguminous crops, vegetables, and fruits, etc.",
  "Black soil is known as black lava soil. This soil black in color and it is formed from lava rocks and is rich In clay. Black soils are very highly retentive of moisture, extremely compact and tenacious when wet, Significantly contracted developing deep wide cracks on drying and self – plowing.\n                Black soils are Credited with very high fertility. These are well suited to leguminous crops such as cotton, turn and Citrus fruits.\n                Black soil is dark, as the name suggests, and fertile with a clay-like consistency. It holds moisture well and becoming hard in dry conditions and sticky in wet conditions. The soil is composed of less than 30 percent clay, wedge-shaped peds, and cracks that open and close periodically. \n               In places with consistent rain, black soil is normally used for growing millet, cotton, soybean, sorghum and pigeon pea. When the soil is irrigated, black soil is used to cultivate other crops, for example, sugar cane, wheat, tobacco, and citrus crops. The soil can be used as a building material. If you are growing crops on commercial scale, you must know about crops suitable for black soil. \n               The black soils are also known as regur and black cotton soils because cotton is the most important Crop grown on these soils. Geographically, the black soils are spread over 5.46 lakh sq km .The black color of soils has been the presence of a small proportion of titaniferous magnetite or even to iron and black constituents of the parent rock. It contains 10 percent of alumina, 9-10 percent of iron oxide and 6-8 percent of lime and the black soils are also known as regur and black cotton soils because cotton is the most important magnesium carbonates. Potash is variable (less than 0.5 percent) phosphates, nitrogen and humus are low. \n               Black soils are mainly found in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu. Black soil gets its color from different salts or humus. Black soil contains a large amount of clay but is sandy as well in hillier regions and this soil contains moderate amounts of phosphorous but is poor in nitrogen.\n                This type of soil is used for rice, wheat, sugarcane, and cotton. It is additionally used to produce groundnut, millet, and oilseeds. Black soil is ideal for growing crops that are cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, wheat, millets, and oilseeds. Black soil is to be the best variety of soil for the cultivation of cotton. Besides cotton, it is also suitable for producing cereals, oilseeds, citrus fruits and vegetables, tobacco and sugarcane. The moisture retentiveness makes them appropriate for dry farming.",
  "Clay is the smallest particles amongst the other two kinds of soil. The particles in this Clay soil are tightly packed together with each other with very little or no airspace. This soil has good water storage qualities and making hard for moisture and air to penetrate into it. It is sticky to the touch when wet, suitable crops for clay soil.\n                Clay is the densest and heaviest type of soil that does not drain well or provides space for plant roots to flourish. Identifying clay soil is relatively easy to do. It is sticky when wet, it can be rolled, it can be smeared simple and it can be smoothed into a shinier finish. Clay soil has a propensity to obtain very hard when it dries, though, which causes the clay to crack while it is drying out.\n                Clay contains little organic material; you often need to add amendments if you wish to grow plants in clay-heavy soil. Without added organic material, clay-heavy soil typically lacks the nutrients and micronutrients necessary for plant growth and photosynthesis. Mineral-heavy clay soils can be alkaline in nature, resulting in the need for additional amendments to balance the soil’s pH. It is very important to test clay-heavy soil before planting to determine both the soil’s pH and whether it lacks important nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. \n               There are mainly four types of clay soil that differ in characteristics depending on the amount of clay in the soil. The different percentages of clay soil contain silt soils that have 0 to 10 percent clay, clay soils with 10 to 25 percent clay, clay soils with 25 to 40 percent clay and clay soils about 40 percent clay. \n               There are several plants that will grow on clay soil. It is good for crops like paddy, which require a lot of water. Clay soil is used for making toys, pots, and many other purposes. Heavy clay soils are slow to warm, so planting early spring crops could not be possible. Heavy clay soils are suitable for crops like Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, Cabbage (red and green), Cabbage (Napa and savoy), Cauliflower, Kale, Bean, Pea, Potato and Daikon radish.",
  "Red soil is a very important soil resource, which bears substantial implications for the sustainable Development of agriculture and the healthy growth of the economy. Red soil develops in a moist Climate under deciduous forest and having thin organic-mineral layers overlying a yellowish-brown Leached layer. \n               Red soils are normally derived from crystalline rock. They are generally poor growing Soils, low in nutrients and difficult to be cultivated because of its low water holding capacity. The major Parent rocks are crystalline and metamorphic rocks such as acid granites, gneisses, and quartzite’s. By and large, the red soils are poor in lime, magnesia, phosphates, nitrogen, and humus, but are rich in potash. The texture of the red soils varies from sand to clay, the majority being loams. On the Uplands, the red soils are thin, poor and gravelly, sandy or Stoney and porous, but in the lower areas, They are rich, dark and fertile.\n                Red soils denote the 3rd largest soil group of India covering an area of about 3.5 lakhs sq. km or 10.6% Of India's area over the Peninsula from Tamil Nadu in the south to Bundelkhand in the north and Rajmahal hills in the east to Katchch in the west. They surround these red soils on their south, east and North. It looks yellow color in its hydrated form.\n                Root crops, such as potatoes and ginger, are demanding feeders that respond well to this superior Fertility. However, there are still some regular problems associated with these soils, and the most Notable of these is related to phosphorus availability. The negatively charged phosphate ion is Notoriously unstable and it will readily form insoluble compounds with calcium (tri-calcium Phosphate), iron, aluminum, and manganese. In red soils, the main problem is iron and these soils are colored red because of an abundance of iron. Phosphate and iron rapidly form the insoluble iron Phosphate, and then it becomes constant battle managing phosphorus for high-production fertility.",
